## 1. [LCS (longest common Subsequence)](https://github.com/kanti170102041/Code_Bank/blob/main/Dynamic%20Programming/Code/lcs.cpp)

Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”.
## 2. [LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence)](https://github.com/kanti170102041/Code_Bank/blob/main/Dynamic%20Programming/Code/lis.cpp)

The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.
## 3. [Edit Distance](https://github.com/kanti170102041/Code_Bank/blob/main/Dynamic%20Programming/Code/edit%20distance.cpp)

Given two strings str1 and str2 and below operations that can performed on str1. Find minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert ‘str1’ into ‘str2’.

1.Insert<br />
2.Remove<br />
3.Replace<br />
All of the above operations are of equal cost.
